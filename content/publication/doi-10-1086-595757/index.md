abstract: 'Abstract: We integrate climatic niche models and dated phylogenies to characterize
  the evolution of climatic niches in Oenothera sections Anogra and Kleinia (Onagraceae),
  and from that we make inferences on diversification in relation to climate. The
  evolution of climatic tolerances in Anogra + Kleinia has been heterogeneous, across
  phylogenetic groups and across different dimensions of climate. All the extant taxa
  occur in semiarid to arid conditions (annual precipitation of 10.1–49.1 cm and high
  temperatures in the warmest month of 28.5°–40.1°C), but there is striking variation
  among taxa in their climatic tolerances, especially temperature (minimum temperatures
  in the coldest month of −14.0° to 5.3°C) and summer versus winter precipitation
  (precipitation in the warmest quarter of 0.6–19.4 cm). Climatic disparity is especially
  pronounced in two subclades (californica, deltoides) that radiated in the southwestern
  United States and California, apparently including both divergent and convergent
  evolution of climatic tolerances. This niche evolution is remarkable, given the
  probable timescale of the radiation (∼1 million years). We suggest that the spatiotemporal
  climatic heterogeneity of western North America has served as a driver of diversification.
  Our data are also consistent with Axelrod’s hypothesis that the spread of arid conditions
  in western North America stimulated diversification of arid‐adapted lineages. '
