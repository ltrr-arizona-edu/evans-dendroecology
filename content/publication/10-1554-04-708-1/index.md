abstract: 'Evolutionary ecologists have long sought to understand the conditions under
  which perennial (iteroparous) versus annual (semelparous) plant life histories are
  favored. We evaluated the idea that aridity and variation in the length of droughts
  should favor the evolution of an annual life history, both by decreasing adult survival
  and by increasing the potential for high seedling survival via reduced plant cover.
  We calculated phylogenetically independent contrasts of climate with respect to
  life history in a clade of winter-establishing evening primroses (sections Anogra
  and Kleinia; Oenothera; Onagraceae), which includes seven annuals, 12 perennials,
  and two variable taxa. Climate variables were quantified from long-term records
  at weather stations near collection localities. To explicitly account for phylogenetic
  uncertainty, contrasts were calculated on a random sample of phylogenetic trees
  from the posterior distribution of a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data. Statements
  of association are based on comparing the per-tree mean contrast, which has a null
  expectation of zero, to a set of per-tree mean contrasts calculated on the same
  trees, after randomizing the climate data. As predicted, increased annual aridity,
  increased annual potential evapotranspiration, and decreased annual precipitation
  were associated with transitions to the annual habit, but these trends were not
  significantly different from the null pattern. Transitions to the annual habit were
  not significantly associated with increases in one measure of aridity in summer
  nor with increased summer drought, but they were associated with significantly increased
  maximum summer temperatures. In winter, increased aridity and decreased precipitation
  were significantly associated with transitions to the annual habit. Changes in life
  history were not significantly associated with changes in the coefficient of variation
  of precipitation, either on an annual or seasonal (summer vs. winter) basis. Though
  we cannot attribute causality on the basis of a correlational, historical study,
  our results are consistent with the idea that increased heat and drought at certain
  times of the year favor the evolution of the annual habit. Increased heat in summer
  may cause adult survival to decline, while increased aridity and decreased precipitation
  in the season of seedling recruitment (winter) may favor a drought-avoiding, short-lived
  annual strategy. Not all of the predicted patterns were observed: the capability
  for drought-induced dormancy may preclude change in habit in response to summer
  drought in our study group.'
