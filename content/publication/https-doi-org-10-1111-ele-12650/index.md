abstract: 'Abstract Predicting long-term trends in forest growth requires accurate
  characterisation of how the relationship between forest productivity and climatic
  stress varies across climatic regimes. Using a network of over two million tree-ring
  observations spanning North America and a space-for-time substitution methodology,
  we forecast climate impacts on future forest growth. We explored differing scenarios
  of increased water-use efficiency (WUE) due to CO2-fertilisation, which we simulated
  as increased effective precipitation. In our forecasts: (1) climate change negatively
  impacted forest growth rates in the interior west and positively impacted forest
  growth along the western, southeastern and northeastern coasts; (2) shifting climate
  sensitivities offset positive effects of warming on high-latitude forests, leaving
  no evidence for continued ‘boreal greening’; and (3) it took a 72% WUE enhancement
  to compensate for continentally averaged growth declines under RCP 8.5. Our results
  highlight the importance of locally adapted forest management strategies to handle
  regional differences in growth responses to climate change.'
