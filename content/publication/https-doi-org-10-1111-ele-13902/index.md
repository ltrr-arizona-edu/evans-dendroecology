abstract: Abstract Estimates of the percentage of species “committed to extinction”
  by climate change range from 15% to 37%. The question is whether factors other than
  climate need to be included in models predicting species’ range change. We created
  demographic range models that include climate vs. climate-plus-competition, evaluating
  their influence on the geographic distribution of Pinus edulis, a pine endemic to
  the semiarid southwestern U.S. Analyses of data on 23,426 trees in 1941 forest inventory
  plots support the inclusion of competition in range models. However, climate and
  competition together only partially explain this species’ distribution. Instead,
  the evidence suggests that climate affects other range-limiting processes, including
  landscape-scale, spatial processes such as disturbances and antagonistic biotic
  interactions. Complex effects of climate on species distributions—through indirect
  effects, interactions, and feedbacks—are likely to cause sudden changes in abundance
  and distribution that are not predictable from a climate-only perspective.
