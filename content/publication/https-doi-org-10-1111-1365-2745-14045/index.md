abstract: 'Abstract Drought legacies in radial tree growth are an important feature
  of variability in biomass accumulation and are widely used to characterize forest
  resilience to climate change. Defined as a deviation from normal growth, the statistical
  significance of legacy effects depends on the definition of “normal”—expected growth
  under average conditions—which has not received sufficient scrutiny. We re-examined
  legacy effect analyses using the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) and then
  produced synthetic tree-ring data to disentangle four key variables influencing
  the magnitude of legacy effects. We hypothesized that legacy effects (i) are mainly
  influenced by the auto-correlation of the radial growth time series (phi), (ii)
  depend on climate-growth cross-correlation (rho), (iii) are directly proportional
  to the inherent variability of the growth time series (standard deviation, SD),
  and (iv) scale with the chosen extreme event threshold. Using a data simulation
  approach, we were able to reproduce observed lag patterns, demonstrating that legacy
  effects are a direct outcome of ubiquitous biological memory. We found that stronger
  legacy effects for conifers compared to angiosperms is a consequence of their higher
  auto-correlation, and that the detectability of legacy effects following rare drought
  events at individual sites is compromised by strong background stochasticity. Synthesis.
  We propose two pathways forward to improve the assessment and interpretation of
  legacy effects: First, we highlight the need to account for auto-correlated residuals
  of climate-growth regression models a posteriori, thereby retrospectively adjusting
  expectations for “normal” growth variability. Alternatively, we recommend including
  lagged climate variables in regression models a priori. By doing so, the magnitude
  of detected legacy effects is greatly reduced and biological memory is directly
  attributed to antecedent climatic drivers. We argue that future analyses should
  focus on understanding the functional reasons for how and why key statistical parameters
  describing this biological memory differ across species and sites. These two pathways
  should also stimulate improved process-based representation of vegetation carbon
  dynamics in mechanistic models.'
