abstract: Summary Integral projection models (IPMs) use information on how an individual's
  state influences its vital rates – survival, growth and reproduction – to make population
  projections. IPMs are constructed from regression models predicting vital rates
  from state variables (e.g. size or age) and covariates (e.g. environment). By combining
  regressions of vital rates, an IPM provides mechanistic insight into emergent ecological
  patterns such as population dynamics, species geographic distributions or life-history
  strategies. Here, we review important resources for building IPMs and provide a
  comprehensive guide, with extensive R code, for their construction. IPMs can be
  applied to any stage-structured population; here, we illustrate IPMs for a series
  of plant life histories of increasing complexity and biological realism, highlighting
  the utility of various regression methods for capturing biological patterns. We
  also present case studies illustrating how IPMs can be used to predict species'
  geographic distributions and life-history strategies. IPMs can represent a wide
  range of life histories at any desired level of biological detail. Much of the strength
  of IPMs lies in the strength of regression models. Many subtleties arise when scaling
  from vital rate regressions to population-level patterns, so we provide a set of
  diagnostics and guidelines to ensure that models are biologically plausible. Moreover,
  IPMs can exploit a large existing suite of analytical tools developed for matrix
  projection models.
