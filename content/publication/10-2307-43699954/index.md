abstract: Patterns of adaptation in response to environmental variation are central
  to our understanding of biodiversity, but predictions of how and when broad-scale
  environmental conditions such as climate affect organismal form and function remain
  incomplete. Succulent plants have evolved in response to arid conditions repeatedly,
  with various plant organs such as leaves, stems, and roots physically modified to
  increase water storage. Here, we investigate the role played by climate conditions
  in shaping the evolution of succulent forms in a plant clade endemic to Madagascar
  and the surrounding islands, part of the hyper-diverse genus Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae).
  We used multivariate ordination of 19 climate variables to identify links between
  particular climate variables and three major forms of succulenceâ€”succulent leaves,
  cactiform stem succulence, and tubers. We then tested the relationship between climatic
  conditions and succulence, using comparative methods that account for shared evolutionary
  history. We confirm that plant water storage is associated with the two components
  of aridity, temperature, and precipitation. Cactiform stem succulence, however,
  is not prevalent in the driest environments, countering the widely held view of
  cactiforms as desert icons. Instead, leaf succulence and tubers are significantly
  associated with the lowest levels of precipitation. Our findings provide a clear
  link between broad-scale climatic conditions and adaptation in land plants, and
  new insights into the climatic conditions favoring different forms of succulence.
  This evidence for adaptation to climate raises concern over the evolutionary future
  of succulent plants as they, along with other organisms, face anthropogenic climate
  change.
