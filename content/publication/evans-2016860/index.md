abstract: Understanding and forecasting speciesâ€™ geographic distributions in the face
  of global change is a central priority in biodiversity science. The existing view
  is that one must choose between correlative models for many species versus process-based
  models for few species. We suggest that opportunities exist to produce process-based
  range models for many species, by using hierarchical and inverse modeling to borrow
  strength across species, fill data gaps, fuse diverse data sets, and model across
  biological and spatial scales. We review the statistical ecology and population
  and range modeling literature, illustrating these modeling strategies in action.
  A variety of large, coordinated ecological datasets that can feed into these modeling
  solutions already exist, and we highlight organisms that seem ripe for the challenge.
