 abstract = {Restoration ecologists are tasked with the challenge of returning an ecological system to a configuration that approximates its natural state (Hobbs and Norton 1996, 2001). Restoring any altered ecosystem comprises a sizeable challenge in that it is critical to determine the appropriate target for restoration (chap. 1), especially prior to disturbances such as novel anthropogenic impacts as well as the relevant scales thereof. Determining the target for restoration involves four main considerations: (1) the ``natural'' state of the system might include pre-European human influences (e.g., widespread colonialism); (2) change is normal in ecological systems (i.e., systems exhibit a historical range of variation in disturbance regimes and species composition); (3) some system changes are completely irreversible (e.g., legacy effects), or nearly so (e.g., ecological tipping points); and (4) stochasticity plays a crucial role in shaping ecosystem state (Jackson and Hobbs 2009). Moreover, some historically important steady states may not be attainable because of legacy effects such as the emergence of novel configurations and the spread of invasive species (e.g., establishing new biotic interactions and ecosystems; Hobbs et al. 2014), prevalence of historical contingencies (e.g., immigration of despotic breeders to isolated populations; Hedrick et al. 2014), or altered boundary constraints (e.g., climatic thresholds such as critical thermal maxima; Lee and Rinne 1980). Nevertheless, historical knowledge of ecosystems may still play a critical role in the success of future restoration efforts in the face of modern-day ecological novelties (Higgs et al. 2014).},
