abstract: "Restoration ecologists are tasked with the challenge of returning an ecological\
  \ system to a configuration that approximates its natural state (Hobbs and Norton\
  \ 1996, 2001). Restoring any altered ecosystem comprises a sizeable challenge in\
  \ that it is critical to determine the appropriate target for restoration (chap.\
  \ 1), especially prior to disturbances such as novel anthropogenic impacts as well\
  \ as the relevant scales thereof. Determining the target for restoration involves\
  \ four main considerations: (1) the ``natural'' state of the system might include\
  \ pre-European human influences (e.g., widespread colonialism); (2) change is normal\
  \ in ecological systems (i.e., systems exhibit a historical range of variation in\
  \ disturbance regimes and species composition); (3) some system changes are completely\
  \ irreversible (e.g., legacy effects), or nearly so (e.g., ecological tipping points);\
  \ and (4) stochasticity plays a crucial role in shaping ecosystem state (Jackson\
  \ and Hobbs 2009). Moreover, some historically important steady states may not be\
  \ attainable because of legacy effects such as the emergence of novel configurations\
  \ and the spread of invasive species (e.g., establishing new biotic interactions\
  \ and ecosystems; Hobbs et al. 2014), prevalence of historical contingencies (e.g.,\
  \ immigration of despotic breeders to isolated populations; Hedrick et al. 2014),\
  \ or altered boundary constraints (e.g., climatic thresholds such as critical thermal\
  \ maxima; Lee and Rinne 1980). Nevertheless, historical knowledge of ecosystems\
  \ may still play a critical role in the success of future restoration efforts in\
  \ the face of modern-day ecological novelties (Higgs et al. 2014)."
