abstract: Climate−tree growth relationships recorded in annual growth rings have recently
  been the basis for projecting climate change impacts on forests. However, most trees
  and sample sites represented in the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) were
  chosen to maximize climate signal and are characterized by marginal growing conditions
  not representative of the larger forest ecosystem. We evaluate the magnitude of
  this potential bias using a spatially unbiased tree-ring network collected by the
  USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. We show that U.S. Southwest ITRDB
  samples overestimate regional forest climate sensitivity by 41–59%, because ITRDB
  trees were sampled at warmer and drier locations, both at the macro- and micro-site
  scale, and are systematically older compared to the FIA collection. Although there
  are uncertainties associated with our statistical approach, projection based on
  representative FIA samples suggests 29% less of a climate change-induced growth
  decrease compared to projection based on climate-sensitive ITRDB samples.
