abstract: 'Abstract Robust ecological forecasting of tree growth under future climate
  conditions is critical to anticipate future forest carbon storage and flux. Here,
  we apply three ingredients of ecological forecasting that are key to improving forecast
  skill: data fusion, confronting model predictions with new data, and partitioning
  forecast uncertainty. Specifically, we present the first fusion of tree-ring and
  forest inventory data within a Bayesian state-space model at a multi-site, regional
  scale, focusing on Pinus ponderosa var. brachyptera in the southwestern US. Leveraging
  the complementarity of these two data sources, we parsed the ecological complexity
  of tree growth into the effects of climate, tree size, stand density, site quality,
  and their interactions, and quantified uncertainties associated with these effects.
  New measurements of trees, an ongoing process in forest inventories, were used to
  confront forecasts of tree diameter with observations, and evaluate alternative
  tree growth models. We forecasted tree diameter and increment in response to an
  ensemble of climate change projections, and separated forecast uncertainty into
  four different causes: initial conditions, parameters, climate drivers, and process
  error. We found a strong negative effect of fall–spring maximum temperature, and
  a positive effect of water-year precipitation on tree growth. Furthermore, tree
  vulnerability to climate stress increases with greater competition, with tree size,
  and at poor sites. Under future climate scenarios, we forecast increment declines
  of 22%–117%, while the combined effect of climate and size-related trends results
  in a 56%–91% decline. Partitioning of forecast uncertainty showed that diameter
  forecast uncertainty is primarily caused by parameter and initial conditions uncertainty,
  but increment forecast uncertainty is mostly caused by process error and climate
  driver uncertainty. This fusion of tree-ring and forest inventory data lays the
  foundation for robust ecological forecasting of aboveground biomass and carbon accounting
  at tree, plot, and regional scales, including iterative improvement of model skill.'
