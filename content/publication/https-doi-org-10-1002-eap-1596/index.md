abstract: Abstract Global environmental change is expected to induce widespread changes
  in the geographic distribution and biomass of forest communities. Impacts have been
  projected from both empirical (statistical) and mechanistic (physiology-based) modelling
  approaches, but there remains an important gap in accurately predicting abundance
  across species' ranges from spatial variation in individual-level demographic processes.
  We address this issue by using a cohort-based forest dynamics model (CAIN) to predict
  spatial variation in the abundance of six plant functional types (PFTs) across the
  eastern United States. The model simulates tree-level growth, mortality, and recruitment,
  which we parameterized from data on both individual-level demographic rates and
  population-level abundance using Bayesian inverse modelling. Across a set of 1°
  grid cells, we calibrated local growth, mortality, and recruitment rates for each
  PFT to obtain a close match between predicted age-specific PFT basal area in forest
  stands and that observed in 46,603 Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. The resulting
  models produced a strong fit to PFT basal area across the region (R2 = 0.66–0.87),
  captured successional changes in PFT composition with stand age, and predicted the
  overall stem diameter distribution well. The mortality rates needed to accurately
  predict basal area were consistently higher than observed mortality, possibly because
  sampling effects led to biased individual-level mortality estimates across spatially
  heterogeneous plots. Growth and recruitment rates did not show consistent directional
  changes from observed values. Relative basal area was most strongly influenced by
  recruitment processes, but the effects of growth and mortality tended to increase
  as stands matured. Our study illustrates how both top-down (population-level) and
  bottom-up (individual-level) data can be combined to predict variation in abundance
  from size, environmental, and competitive effects on tree demography. Evidence for
  how demographic processes influence variation in abundance, as provided by our model,
  can help in understanding how these forests may respond to future environmental
  change.
