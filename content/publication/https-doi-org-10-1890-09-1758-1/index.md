abstract: Understanding and predicting changes in the abundance of natural populations
  is a central goal of ecology. These changes are influenced by a variety of exogenous
  processes (weather, floods, fire); variation in these processes leads to variation
  in vital rates (survival, fecundity) that may be positively or negatively correlated
  across the life cycle. We used 20 years of data and a hierarchical Bayesian model
  to estimate vital rates and their covariation in an endangered plant, Dicerandra
  frutescens ssp. frutescens (Lamiaceae), as a function of time since fire and random
  year effects. Germination and the number of flowering branches declined with time
  since fire, and all plants were increasingly likely to become nonreproductive with
  time since fire. Time since fire had negative effects on survival of seedlings,
  vegetative plants, and small flowering plants, and positive effects on survival
  of medium and large flowering plants. Model comparison strongly supported inclusion
  of time-since-fire effects and weakly supported inclusion of year effects influencing
  all vital rates (“model-wide” year effects). We used samples from the joint posterior
  distribution of model parameters to simulate population dynamics as a function of
  fire regime and year-to-year environmental variation. These simulations suggest
  that populations of Dicerandra frutescens ssp. frutescens are least likely to go
  extinct if the average time between fires is ∼24–30 years. The design of the simulations
  allowed us to distinguish variation in stochastic population growth associated with
  process variability (fire, year effects, and demographic stochasticity) from variation
  associated with parameter uncertainty (finite amounts of data). Even with 20 years
  of data, half or more of the uncertainty in population growth rates was due to parameter
  uncertainty. This hierarchical Bayesian population viability analysis illustrates
  a general analytical framework for (1) estimating vital rates as a function of an
  exogenous environmental factor, (2) accounting for covariation among vital rates,
  and (3) simulating population dynamics as a function of stochastic environmental
  processes while taking into account uncertainty about their effects. We discuss
  future areas of development for this approach.
