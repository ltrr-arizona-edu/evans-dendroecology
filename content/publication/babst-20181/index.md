abstract: The demand for large-scale and long-term information on tree growth is increasing
  rapidly as environmental change research strives to quantify and forecast the impacts
  of continued warming on forest ecosystems. This demand, combined with the now quasi-global
  availability of tree-ring observations, has inspired researchers to compile large
  tree-ring networks to address continental or even global-scale research questions.
  However, these emergent spatial objectives contrast with paleo-oriented research
  ideas that have guided the development of many existing records. A series of challenges
  related to how, where, and when samples have been collected is complicating the
  transition of tree rings from a local to a global resource on the question of tree
  growth. Herein, we review possibilities to scale tree-ring data (A) from the sample
  to the whole tree, (B) from the tree to the site, and (C) from the site to larger
  spatial domains. Representative tree-ring sampling supported by creative statistical
  approaches is thereby key to robustly capture the heterogeneity of climate-growth
  responses across forested landscapes. We highlight the benefits of combining the
  temporal information embedded in tree rings with the spatial information offered
  by forest inventories and earth observations to quantify tree growth and its drivers.
  In addition, we show how the continued development of mechanistic tree-ring models
  can help address some of the non-linearities and feedbacks that complicate making
  inference from tree-ring data. By embracing scaling issues, the discipline of dendrochronology
  will greatly increase its contributions to assessing climate impacts on forests
  and support the development of adaptation strategies.
