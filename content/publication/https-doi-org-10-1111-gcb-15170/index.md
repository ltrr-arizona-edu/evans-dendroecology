abstract: "Abstract A central challenge in global change research is the projection\
  \ of the future behavior of a system based upon past observations. Tree-ring data\
  \ have been used increasingly over the last decade to project tree growth and forest\
  \ ecosystem vulnerability under future climate conditions. But how can the response\
  \ of tree growth to past climate variation predict the future, when the future does\
  \ not look like the past? Space-for-time substitution (SFTS) is one way to overcome\
  \ the problem of extrapolation: the response at a given location in a warmer future\
  \ is assumed to follow the response at a warmer location today. Here we evaluated\
  \ an SFTS approach to projecting future growth of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii),\
  \ a species that occupies an exceptionally large environmental space in North America.\
  \ We fit a hierarchical mixed-effects model to capture ring-width variability in\
  \ response to spatial and temporal variation in climate. We found opposing gradients\
  \ for productivity and climate sensitivity with highest growth rates and weakest\
  \ response to interannual climate variation in the mesic coastal part of Douglas-fir's\
  \ range; narrower rings and stronger climate sensitivity occurred across the semi-arid\
  \ interior. Ring-width response to spatial versus temporal temperature variation\
  \ was opposite in sign, suggesting that spatial variation in productivity, caused\
  \ by local adaptation and other slow processes, cannot be used to anticipate changes\
  \ in productivity caused by rapid climate change. We thus substituted only climate\
  \ sensitivities when projecting future tree growth. Growth declines were projected\
  \ across much of Douglas-fir's distribution, with largest relative decreases in\
  \ the semiarid U.S. Interior West and smallest in the mesic Pacific Northwest. We\
  \ further highlight the strengths of mixed-effects modeling for reviving a conceptual\
  \ cornerstone of dendroecology, Cook's 1987 aggregate growth model, and the great\
  \ potential to use tree-ring networks and results as a calibration target for next-generation\
  \ vegetation models."
