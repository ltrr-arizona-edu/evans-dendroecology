abstract: Tree-ring time series provide long-term, annually resolved information on
  the growth of trees. When sampled in a systematic context, tree-ring data can be
  scaled to estimate the forest carbon capture and storage of landscapes, biomes,
  and—ultimately—the globe. A systematic effort to sample tree rings in national forest
  inventories would yield unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution of forest
  carbon dynamics and help resolve key scientific uncertainties, which we highlight
  in terms of evidence for forest greening (enhanced growth) versus browning (reduced
  growth, increased mortality). We describe jump-starting a tree-ring collection across
  the continent of North America, given the commitments of Canada, the United States,
  and Mexico to visit forest inventory plots, along with existing legacy collections.
  Failing to do so would be a missed opportunity to help chart an evidence-based path
  toward meeting national commitments to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, urgently
  needed for climate stabilization and repair.
