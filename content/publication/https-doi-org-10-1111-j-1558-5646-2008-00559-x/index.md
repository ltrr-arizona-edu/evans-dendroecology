abstract: The arms race of adaptation and counter adaptation in predator–prey interactions
  is a fascinating evolutionary dynamic with many consequences, including local adaptation
  and the promotion or maintenance of diversity. Although such antagonistic coevolution
  is suspected to be widespread in nature, experimental documentation of the process
  remains scant, and we have little understanding of the impact of ecological conditions.
  Here, we present evidence of predator–prey coevolution in a long-term experiment
  involving the predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and the prey Pseudomonas
  fluorescens, which has three morphs (SM, FS, and WS). Depending on experimentally
  applied disturbance regimes, the predator–prey system followed two distinct evolutionary
  trajectories, where the prey evolved to be either super-resistant to predation (SM
  morph) without counter-adaptation by the predator, or moderately resistant (FS morph),
  specialized to and coevolving with the predator. Although predation-resistant FS
  morphs suffer a cost of resistance, the evolution of extreme resistance to predation
  by the SM morph was apparently unconstrained by other traits (carrying capacity,
  growth rate). Thus we demonstrate empirically that ecological conditions can shape
  the evolutionary trajectory of a predator–prey system.
