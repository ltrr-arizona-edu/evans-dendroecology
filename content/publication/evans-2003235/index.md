abstract: We investigated the reproductive biology of three plants endemic to rosemary
  scrub habitats on the Lake Wales Ridge of Florida, USA. We used hand-pollination
  experiments and observations of flowers and their insect visitors to determine their
  mating systems and pollination. Fruit or seed set after self pollination was 94,
  97, and 8% of fruit or seed set after cross pollination in Eryngium cuneifolium
  (Apiaceae), Hypericum cumulicola (Hypericaceae), and Liatris ohlingerae (Asteraceae)
  respectively, indicating that the first two are self-compatible and the last is
  obligately outcrossing. All three depend on insects for seed production (4â€“7% fruit
  or seed set without insects). Diverse insects visit flowers of E. cuneifolium (101
  species recorded), whereas L. ohlingerae is visited predominantly by butterflies
  and H. cumulicola by one genus of bees (Dialictus, Halictidae). Our data indicate
  pollinator visitation does not currently limit seed production in E. cuneifolium
  or H. cumulicola, but does in L. ohlingerae. Despite the features they share (habit,
  habitat, disturbance regime), we found unique aspects of these species' reproductive
  biology yielding unique risks to population viability. We suggest that multispecies
  recovery plans must consider several aspects of the biology of species with superficial
  similarities to be successful.
