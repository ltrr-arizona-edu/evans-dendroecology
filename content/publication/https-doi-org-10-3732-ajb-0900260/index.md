abstract: '• Premise of the study: We examined two accounts of the relationship between
  breeding system and life history variation in a clade of evening primroses (Oenothera,
  Onagraceae): (1) selection for reproductive assurance should generate an association
  between self-compatibility and monocarpy and (2) phylogenetic conservatism leads
  to retention of breeding system and life history traits among closely related taxa.
  • Methods: We performed over 4000 hand pollinations under greenhouse conditions
  to determine the compatibility of 10 Oenothera taxa (sections Anogra [17 taxa] and
  Kleinia [2 taxa)] for which breeding systems had not previously been reported. We
  used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the influence of pollination treatment,
  parents, and population on fruiting success. • Key results: Among the taxa tested,
  six were self-incompatible, two were variable in compatibility, and two were self-compatible.
  We combined these data with published studies in Anogra and Kleinia and mapped breeding
  system and life history onto a published phylogeny. • Conclusions: We found no evidence
  for phylogenetic conservatism, but detected considerable evolutionary lability in
  both traits. Additionally, we found no evidence for a consistent relationship between
  breeding system and life history. Only eight of 19 taxa followed the predicted association
  between self-incompatibility and polycarpy vs. self-compatibility and monocarpy.
  Instead, many taxa have retained self-incompatibility, regardless of monocarpy or
  polycarpy.'
