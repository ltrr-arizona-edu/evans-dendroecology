abstract: " Predicting how and when adaptive evolution might rescue species from global\
  \ change, and integrating this process into tools of biodiversity forecasting, has\
  \ now become an urgent task. Here, we explored whether recent population trends\
  \ of species can be explained by their past rate of niche evolution, which can be\
  \ inferred from increasingly available phylogenetic and niche data. We examined\
  \ the assemblage of 409 European bird species for which estimates of demographic\
  \ trends between 1970 and 2000 are available, along with a species-level phylogeny\
  \ and data on climatic, habitat and trophic niches. We found that species' proneness\
  \ to demographic decline is associated with slow evolution of the habitat niche\
  \ in the past, in addition to certain current-day life-history and ecological traits.\
  \ A similar result was found at a higher taxonomic level, where families prone to\
  \ decline have had a history of slower evolution of climatic and habitat niches.\
  \ Our results support the view that niche conservatism can prevent some species\
  \ from coping with environmental change. Thus, linking patterns of past niche evolution\
  \ and contemporary species dynamics for large species samples may provide insights\
  \ into how niche evolution may rescue certain lineages in the face of global change. "
