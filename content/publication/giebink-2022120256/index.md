abstract: Forest management has the potential to contribute to the removal of greenhouse
  gasses from the atmosphere via carbon sequestration and storage. To identify management
  actions that will maximize carbon removal and storage over the long term, models
  are needed that accurately and realistically represent forest responses to changing
  climate. The most widely used growth and yield model in the United States (U.S.),
  the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS), which also forms the basis for several forest
  carbon calculators, does not currently include the direct effect of climate variation
  on tree growth. We incorporated the effects of climate on tree diameter growth by
  combining tree-ring data with forest inventory data to parameterize a suite of alternative
  models characterizing the growth of three dominant tree species in the arid and
  moisture-limited state of Utah. These species, Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws, Pseudotsuga
  menziesii var. glauca Mayr (Franco), and Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm., encompass
  the full elevational range of montane forest types. The alternative models we considered
  differed progressively from the current FVS large-tree diameter growth model, first
  by changing to an annual time step, then by adding interannual climate effects,
  followed by model simplification (removal of predictors), and finally, complexification,
  including effects of spatial variation in climate and two-way interactions between
  predictors. We validated diameter growth predictions from these models with independent
  observations, and evaluated model performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and
  bias. We then compared predictions of future growth made by the existing large-tree
  diameter growth model used in FVS, i.e., without climate effects, to those of our
  updated models, including those with climate effects. We found that simpler models
  of tree growth outperform the current FVS model, and that the incorporation of climate
  effects improves model performance for two out of three species, in which growth
  is currently overpredicted by FVS. Diameter growth projected with improved, climate-sensitive
  models is less than the future tree growth projected by the current climate-insensitive
  FVS model. Tree rings can be used to identify and incorporate drivers of growth
  variation into a stand-level growth and yield model, giving more accurate predictions
  of the carbon uptake potential of forests under climate change.
