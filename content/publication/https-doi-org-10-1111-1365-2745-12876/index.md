abstract: 'Abstract Tropical forest mortality is controlled by both biotic and abiotic
  processes, but how these processes interact to determine forest structure is not
  well understood. Using long-term demography data from permanent forest plots at
  the Paracou Tropical Forest Research Station in French Guiana, we analysed the relative
  influence of competition and climate on tree mortality. We found that self-thinning
  is evident at the stand level, and is associated with clumped mortality at smaller
  scales (<2 m) and regular spacing of living trees at intermediate (2.5–7.5 m) scales.
  A competition index (CI) based on spatial clustering of dead trees was used to build
  predictive mortality models, which also accounted for climate interactions. The
  model that most closely fitted observations included both the CI and climatic variables,
  with climate-only and competition-only models less informative than the full model.
  There was strong evidence for U-shaped size-specific mortality, with highest mortality
  for small and very large trees, as well as sensitivity of trees to drought, especially
  when temperatures were high, and when soils were water saturated. The effect of
  the CI was more complex than expected a priori: a higher CI was associated with
  lower mortality odds, which we hypothesize is caused by gap-phase dynamics, but
  there was also evidence for competition-induced mortality at very high CI values.
  The strong signature of competition as a control over mortality at the stand and
  individual scales confirms its important role in determining tropical forest structure.
  The complexity of the competition-mortality relationship and its interaction with
  climate indicates that a thorough consideration of the scale of analysis is needed
  when inferring the role of competition in tropical forests, but demonstrates that
  climate-only mortality models can be significantly improved by including competition
  effects, even when ignoring species-specific effects. Synthesis. Empirical models
  such as the one developed here can help constrain and improve process-based vegetation
  models, serving both as a benchmark and as a means to disentangle mortality processes.
  Tropical vegetation dynamic models would benefit greatly from explicitly considering
  the role of competition in stand development and self-thinning while modelling demography,
  as well as its interaction with climate.'
