abstract: 'Summary • Competing evolutionary forces shape plant breeding systems (e.g.
  inbreeding depression, reproductive assurance). Which of these forces prevails in
  a given population or species is predicted to depend upon such factors as life history,
  ecological conditions, and geographical context. Here, we examined two such predictions:
  that self-compatibility should be associated with the annual life history or extreme
  climatic conditions. • We analyzed data from a clade of plants remarkable for variation
  in breeding system, life history and climatic conditions (Oenothera, sections Anogra
  and Kleinia, Onagraceae). We used a phylogenetic comparative approach and Bayesian
  or hybrid Bayesian tests to account for phylogenetic uncertainty. Geographic information
  system (GIS)-based climate data and ecological niche modeling allowed us to quantify
  climatic conditions. • Breeding system and reproductive life span are not correlated
  in Anogra and Kleinia. Instead, self-compatibility is associated with the extremes
  of temperature in the coldest part of the year and precipitation in the driest part
  of the year. • In the 60 yr since this pattern was anticipated, this is the first
  demonstration of a relationship between the evolution of self-compatibility and
  climatic extremes. We discuss possible explanations for this pattern and possible
  implications with respect to anthropogenic climate change.'
