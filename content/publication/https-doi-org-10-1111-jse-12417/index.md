abstract: Abstract Multiple processes − including dispersal, morphological innovation,
  and habitat change − are frequently cited as catalysts for increased diversification.
  We investigate these processes and the causal linkages among them in the genus Cyphostemma
  (Vitaceae), a clade comprising ∼200 species that is unique in the Vitaceae for its
  diversity of growth habits. We reconstruct time-calibrated evolutionary relationships
  among 64 species in the genus using five nuclear and chloroplast markers and infer
  the group's morphological and biogeographic history. We test for changes in speciation
  rate and evaluate the temporal association and sequencing of events with respect
  to dispersal, habitat change, and morphological evolution using a Monte Carlo simulation
  approach. In Cyphostemma, neither dispersal nor morphological evolution is associated
  with shifts in speciation rate, but dispersal is associated with evolutionary shifts
  in growth form. Evolution of stem succulence, in particular, is associated with
  adaptation to local, pre-existing conditions following long-distance dispersal,
  not habitat change in situ. We suggest that the pattern of association between dispersal,
  morphological innovation, and diversification may depend on the particular characters
  under study. Lineages with evolutionarily labile characters, such as stem succulence,
  do not necessarily conform to the notion of niche conservatism and instead demonstrate
  remarkable morphological adaptation to local climate and edaphic conditions following
  dispersal.
