Margaret Evans' connection to the ecosystems of the interior western U.S. began at age 8, when she first attended the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry’s science camp at Hancock Field Station near the John Day fossil beds of eastern Oregon. Her 25-year record in ecology includes work for The Nature Conservancy, the U.S. Forest Service, Archbold Biological Station (in south-central Florida), Yale University, and the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, France, along with field experience in the Pacific Northwest, Florida, Papua New Guinea, and the desert Southwest. 

Her research has ranged widely, encompassing conservation biology, evolutionary ecology, population biology, systematic biology, and statistical ecology, with a central organizing theme of demography. It was the idea of applying demographic models at the scale of species’ geographic distributions—in order to anticipate the effects of climate change on those species—that brought her to tree rings. She focuses on combining tree-ring and forest inventory data to quantify how trees are affected by climate variation and how forest ecosystems feedback on the climate system via their role in the carbon cycle. Her research group is helping to develop a new tree-ring data network sampled in forest inventory plots throughout the western U.S., in collaboration with the U.S. Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis Program. The climate-growth relationships encoded in tree rings are then used to make projections of future tree growth—“ecological forecasts” of future forest ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services—and form the basis for forest management tools. Her perspective on these global change questions is further informed by her appreciation for the importance of ecological disturbances (e.g., fire and insect outbreaks) and life history evolution.

Margaret is an active teacher and mentor, and has a diverse research group exploring a variety of important questions at the LTRR.
