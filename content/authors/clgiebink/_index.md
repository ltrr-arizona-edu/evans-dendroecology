I am passionate about using data to bridge the gap between basic ecology and natural resources management, including the conservation of biodiversity. I use statistical models to quantify and understand the effects of land-use and climate change on speciesâ€™ performance, abundance, and geographic distributions, through the lens of the demographic niche. By quantifying the major drivers of population dynamics, I seek to improve ecological forecasting under alternative management scenarios and accelerate the process of adaptive management.
