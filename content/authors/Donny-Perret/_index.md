I am currently an ORISE postdoctoral fellow with the US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station. My work seeks to understand and predict the dramatic ways that human actions are altering the planet's ecology, with the goal of improving conservation and management outcomes. My current research leverages large-scale forest inventory data, tree-ring records, non-native distributions, and ecological niche theory to investigate the future of western North American forests in light of changing climatic and disturbance regimes.
