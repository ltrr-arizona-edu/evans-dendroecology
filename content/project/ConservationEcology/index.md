My earliest work contributed to basic knowledge, either in terms of demography, reproductive biology, or genetic diversity, of the following rare plants: _Asimina obovata_ (_Annonaceae_), _Cimicifuga elata_ (_Ranunculaceae_), _Dicerandra frutescens_ (pictured, photo by Reed Bowman) and _D. christmanii_ (_Lamiaceae_), _Eryngium cuneifolium_ (_Apiaceae_), _Hypericum cumulicola_ (_Hypericaceae_), _Liatris ohlingerae_ (_Asteraceae_), _Nolina brittoniana_ (_Asparagaceae_), and _Warea carteri_ (_Brassicaceae_). Most of these are plants endemic to Florida scrub that I worked with at Archbold Biological Station under Eric Menges.
